# üê∏ Welcome

## IMPORTANT NOTE: As of 2/7/2022, Froggie is undergoing major changes that dramatically decrease the uptime. This is because Discord is forcing all bots to switch to Slash Commands, whereas Froggie currently uses Message Commands. I hope to have Froggie back up soon.

Froggie is a Discord bot jam-packed with commands. Feel free to read Froggie's docs, which you can find at [docs.froggie.cc](https://docs.froggie.cc)! Froggie currently has about 40 commands, and is certified on [Discord.boats](https://discord.boats/bot/917288138156683285). Here's some help navigating this repository:
- [commands](/commands): pretty self-explanitory, this is the folder that contains all of Froggie's commands.
- [events](/events): this folder contains client events, which essentially waits to see when something happens, e.g. when a member sends a message, when a user joins a guild, or when the bot comes online.
- [img](/img): images that the bot uses!
### Froggie has an [official website](https://froggie.cc/), official [support server](https://discord.com/invite/4s7vkhKtjk), and is listed on [discord.boats](https://discord.boats/bot/917288138156683285), [top.gg](https://top.gg/bot/917288138156683285), and [discord.bots.gg](https://discord.bots.gg/bots/917288138156683285)!
